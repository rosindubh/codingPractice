CREATING A MONGOOSE DATABASE
----------------------------

Create a GitHub repository using the name of your project and clone it.

Before you do anything run npm init -y

Then make a .gitignore to include /node_modules and .env
Then make a .env file which contains the MONGO_URI = <connection URI goes here>
Remember to edit the URI to contain the correct username and password. Add a different cluster name if different.

Next make a src folder
Inside the src folder create a file called app.js
Then inside the src folder create a db folder and a films folder.
Next inside db folder create a file called connection.js
Next inside the films folder create 2 files. One called film.methods.js and one called film.model.js
NOTE THE NAMES film.methods and film.model CAN BE WHATEVER SUITS YOUR PARTICULAR PROJECT.
