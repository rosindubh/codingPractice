React.js

NOTE: props and components are very important

Three major players:    React.js    Vue     Angular

JSX-HTML converts to standard JavaScript

A component can be either a function or a class.

Functional Components
App is the root component

There is a virtual DOM and an actual DOM. React updates the actual DOM if the virtual DOM changes.

Standard practice is to name function components starting with a capital letter.

There can only be one parent element, most commonly a <div> tag

React.createElement(      this is JavaScript
Component<                this is JSX

The name of the compiler is Babel

To start a new project enter the following into the terminal. Making sure you are in the right directory.

npx create-react-app [name of the app goes here]

Afternoon session
-----------------

You cannot use the word class in React, class is a keyword inside React. Use className instead.

State & Methods
----------------

useState hook (research this)

NOTE: hooks do not work inside classes

You can only pass props down the tree not up it.

Check out Netninja for React and read the React Documentation

Example of using useState:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

The useState function returns a pair of values which we restructure with []
The first is a value, the second is a function to update the first

Think of the state as a kind of storee, which holds the current state
of the application.

When the app loads, it will be rendered with the initial state (that you coded in)
but as uses interact with your app, there state can change

As well as having a state property inside our component, we can also have different
methods (functions) which can do different things to our user interface

go to settings and search for emmet, where it says emmet include languages
add javascript to item and javascriptreact to value
this will allow auto complete in the editor. eg type div.home and hit enter and it 
will look like this:
<div className="home"></div>

install Simple React Snippets.
you can now create a stateless functional component  by typing sfc and hitting Tab
this will look like this:

const  = () => {
    return (  );
}
 
export default ;

you then need to fill in the function name and it will look something like this:

const Navbar = () => {
    return (  );
}
 
export default Navbar;
