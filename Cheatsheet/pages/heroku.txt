SETTING UP A NEW PROJECT
------------------------

Select New at the top right of the page

From dropdown menu select create new app

Add an App name and choose region (Europe in our case)

Don't add a pipeline (Used for working with CI/CD )

Select Create App

Click on GitHub for the deployment method

Enter Repo name in the Seach box and click search

Once found click on connect

Select GitHub branch (usually main)

Don't select wait for CI to pass before deploy

Don't Enable Automatic deploy

BEFORE DEPLOYING BRANCH GO TO SETTINGS

Click the Reveal config Vars button

Add MONGO_URI in the KEY box and the Mongo connection string in the Value box

Next add Your SECRET in the same way (basically the contents of your .env file)

Next add a buildpack in our case nodejs

NEXT GOT TO GitHub AND THE Repo YOU ARE DEPLOYING AND DO THE FOLLOWING

Inside the parent directory create a new file called .Procfile
On the first line write what is called a dyno, this is a script that will run the program
Add the following line to the .Procfile
web: npm start

Next open your package.json file and check to see if you have a start script
If you don't then add one like this:
"start": "node src/server.js"
DON'T FORGET THE COMMA AT THE END OF THE LINE
THIS CAN BE DONE IN LOCAL REPO AND PUSHED TO GitHub

Go back to HeroKu and select Deploy from menubar at the top, 
go all the way to the bottom and Deploy Branch
Go to the top click on More and select view logs and confirm the build has no errors
If you put a console log in your connection.js file it will output in the logs on HJeroKu

Now go to settings and where the Domains Title is on the left, 
the Domain URL will be listed on the right
This is what goes into your fetch request in your frontend
