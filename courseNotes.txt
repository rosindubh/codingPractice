# phil welsby - CodeNation Master27 Course Notes

Monday 23 August 2021
Morning session
---------------

Testing using jest:
To set up the environment:
1) create a folder with no spaces.
2) create 2 files called [app.js] and [app.test.js]
3) run: <npm init -y>
4) run: <npm install --save-dev jest>
5) edit line 7 of the package.json file to read ["test": "jest"]

First we create the [app.test.js] file adding [let app = require("./app");]
so we can acquire the app.js files contents.
To run the test we enter: [npm test]
The test will at this stage fail. Next create a function or whatever that we are 
testing for in the app.js file, and export the contents as follows:
module.exports = {
  <enter the name of the apps here with a comma after each like this>
  add,
  myFunction,
  philsFunctions,
  noOfFunctions: 3
}

If these 3 functions existed in the [app.js] file they would be accessible to the [app.test.js] file.

We only covered Test Driven Development (TDD) today. Other type of testing are:
Integration Testing
Functional Testing

React.js

NOTE: props and components are very important

Three major players:    React.js    Vue     Angular

JSX-HTML converts to standard JavaScript

A component can be either a function or a class.

Functional Components
App is the root component

There is a virtual DOM and an actual DOM. React updates the actual DOM if the virtual DOM changes.

Standard practice is to name function components starting with a capital letter.

There can only be one parent element, most commonly a <div> tag

React.createElement(      this is JavaScript
Component<                this is JSX

The name of the compiler is Babel

To start a new project enter the following into the terminal. Making sure you are in the right directory.

npx create-react-app [name of the app goes here]

Afternoon session
-----------------

You cannot use the word class in React, class is a keyword inside React. Use className instead.

State & Methods
----------------

useState hook (research this)

NOTE: hooks do not work inside classes

You can only pass props down the tree not up it.
