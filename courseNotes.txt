Morning 
Testing using jest:
To set up the environment:
1) create a folder with no spaces.
2) create 2 files called [app.js] and [app.test.js]
3) run: <npm init -y>
4) run: <npm install --save-dev jest>
5) edit line 7 of the package.json file to read ["test": "jest"]

First we create the [app.test.js] file adding [let app = require("./app");]
so we can aquire the app.js files contents.
To run the test we enter: [npm test]
The test will at this stage fail. Next create a function or whatever that we are 
testing for in the app.js file, and export the contents as follows:
module.exports = {
  <enter the name of the apps here with a comma after each like this>
  add,
  myFunction,
  philsFunctions,
  noOfFunctions: 3
}

If these 3 functions existed in the [app.js] file they would be accessable to the [app.test.js] file.

We only covered Test Driven Development (TDD) today. Other type of testing are:
Intergration Testing
Functional Testing
